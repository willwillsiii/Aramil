itemTableFile -> KennyScript -> shit load of class files for each item
i.e. inside coreItems is entry Longsword -> your script takes the table
	entry and outputs a class file for the longsword that inherits
	the weapon class (which inherits the item class)

There will probably be a template set up that will contain the usual
getters/setters for the subclass (weapon in this case) and your script
will read in the values to put into that template from Henry's script

For now work on making a script that takes in values from Henry's table
and stores each line into a dictionary. You can use the name as the key,
but for the value use a list that contains the entire line of the table
in the same order of Henry's columns.
